## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to continue a pipeline in Python to analyse stock data. We aim to integrate it with daily news headline data to measure how reliably sentiment analysis can predict stock prices. Due to stocks being heavily influenced by investors sentiments upon economy and the market, a sentiment analysis could offer new variables of prediction for updated stock prices leading to greater opportunities for profit.

### Methods Used
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* Jupyter

## Project Description
Our current sample dataset contains 9 weeks of Amazon stock prices. We currently are able to create classes that can measure the mean, median and standart deviation of the stock prices to predict its ups and downs in prices. Once those statistics were analyzed for the stock we can trace the week in which the prices were most affected and in the future we can analyse the price difference according to the news headlines.
